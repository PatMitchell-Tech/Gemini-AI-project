For my emerging technologies in information systems course me and two fellow students came up with the idea of using google's Gemini artificial intelligence to assist in our fictional money management business.

In this project we used prompts to generate operating costs, debt, d/e ratios, revenue, net profit, and cogs for struggling businesses. We used gemini to find roadblocks to success as well as assistance in creating customer reports.

Each week we would have one person become the group leader and submit a report to our professor at the end of the week. This taught us how to be responsible for a part of the project and to effectively work together as a team.

Throughout this project we used effective communication with each other to help solve problems and complete our project. We learned how to effectively analyze financial problems within businesses using artificial intelligence.
